XSS:

practice: http://leettime.net/xsslab1
	  prompt.ml

1)Search for input parameters

2)Search in search bar, comment section, signup, login etc.

3)If it reflect back to you there may be XSS

4)Try to embed any javascript code there

5)If your js is not reflected and is in form of value to parameter like this,
<a href="params.php?p=valid&pp=hello">
try to complete that parameter value and tag like this, 
<a href="params.php?p=valid&pp="><script>alert("hello")</script>">

6)sometimes point 5) also don't work then try to use mouse event like onmouseover
'onmouseover=alert(1)'

7)Look for single and double quotes and try to complete them and then apply onmouseover event in some cases.

8)whenever your input reflect as plain text you should use svg vectors like this,
<svg/onload=alert(1);
#you can use html encoding like this to execute specific character, ( => &#40 

9)if they take url as input field you can try to inject payload through file, for that create a file and write <script>alert(1)</script>. If it successfully executed it will be remote file xss or rxss.

10)if your payload is converted into type="text", = and other tags are being filtered you can give like this,
hi"type=image src onerror
="alert(1)




How to check for xss on any website?
1)Spider/crawl all the url

2)Filter urls having parameter and send that url to repeater

3)Check if your input is reflecting or not in repeater tab

4)If it's reflecting send that request to intruder tab and there inject any JS code there either manually or by using xss payloads file. Then start attack

5)First it will try with 0 payload check its length, any other payload length greater than of 0th payload it may be vulnerable to xss.

6)show responce in browser and copy that url in browser, turn off intercept.
